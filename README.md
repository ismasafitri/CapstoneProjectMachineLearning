Outfit Recommendation System using Multi Label Classification - Machine Learning Path - Bangkit

The project "Outfit Recommendation System" aims to solve the problem of a lack of inspiration in finding a fashion style that suits the user's preferences. This problem arises due to a lack of time, knowledge, or resources to effectively explore the various fashion style options available. The project proposes a mobile application that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the style, color, and pattern of clothing scanned by users and provides appropriate and relevant fashion style recommendations. The research questions of the project include developing accurate machine learning algorithms, measuring user satisfaction with the fashion style recommendations provided by the app, and assessing the impact of the application on users' confidence and satisfaction with their appearance. The project targets individuals interested in fashion and wants to provide better accessibility and inspiration for exploring various fashion style options that suit user preferences. The team has various reasons for tackling the challenge of finding a suitable fashion style for users, including personal interest in fashion, market demand for a fashion recommendation system that caters to individual preferences, and the belief that an effective system can positively impact users' confidence and satisfaction with their appearance.
